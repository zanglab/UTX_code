==
data_202101_trim_bigwig
	use bam file (from data_202101_trim) 
	to generate bigwig files for both + and - strands
	1. merge two replicates and KEEP duplicated reads
	2. separate each replicate and KEEP duplicated reads

==
data_202101_trim_rDNA_remove
	it should be fine not to remove the ribosome sequencing as
	- we have paired-end reads
	- we focus on the normalized reads at the specific region
