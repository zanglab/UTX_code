re-run the k4me3 data, using the re-processed data from trimmed .fz
consistent with the results in

==
run k27 hichip data using sicer islads called from final selected 202102 k27 chipseq data 
re-run the k4me3 data, so no need to select from two folders in down-stream analysis
consistent with the results in 
- data_1st_submit_sicer2_merged_islands_new



NOTES:
- In each sub-folder, use bedpe2tabix to generate longrange interaction files for WashU browser visualizaiton
- In each sub-folder, keep only those NON singleton summit loop to check the genome wide looping changes
