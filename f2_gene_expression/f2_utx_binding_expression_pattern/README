==
f1_UTX_binding_promoter_overlap
==
for each UTX binding region, get the genes (TSS) that are overlapped with 
- UTX binding sites
- UTX binding sites +/-2kb
- UTX binding sites +/-10kb


==
f2_utx_binding_DEG_figs
==
compare the expression of 
- all genes
- genes near UTX binding sites
- genes near UTX binding sites that also with increased K4me1
in WT vs. Vector, DEL vs. WT and EIF vs. DEL
for each type of UTX binding sites


==
f3_utx_binding_DEG_logFC_scatter
==
compare the expression of 
- all genes
- genes near UTX binding sites
and check the logFC in 
- WT vs. Vector against DEL vs. WT
- DEL vs. WT against EIF vs. DEL


==
f4_utx_binding_DEG_figs_w_k27ac
==
compare the expression of 
- all genes
- genes near UTX binding sites
- genes near UTX binding sites that also with increased k27ac
in WT vs. Vector, DEL vs. WT and EIF vs. DEL
for each type of UTX binding sites
