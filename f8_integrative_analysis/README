==
data
	combined data of gene expression, DCI and hm RPKM of each gene
	

==
f1_gene_expr_cor_DCI_patterns
	check DEG between WT and Vector and how they change in DEL
	check genes with positive DCI value in WT vs. Vec., and analyze their DCIs in DEL vs. WT


==
f2_expr_DCI_cor_HM_RPKM
	check association between
	expression vs. RP changes
	DCI vs. RP changes
	
	then select those genes with increased k4m3 DCI, k4m1 RP and expression,
	do David GO analysis
