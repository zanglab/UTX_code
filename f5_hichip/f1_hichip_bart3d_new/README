f0_run_bart3d_new
==
bart3d results with updated bart3d allowing normalized by read coverage

==
f1_DEG_promoter_DCI
f2_DEG_promoter_DCI_non_normalized
==
map differential chromatin interaction (DCI, w/ or w/o normalization) to gene promoter region, 
check correlation between 
- gene expression log2FC and 
- hichip DCI




!!!! for UTX binding sites, 
you need to keep each and every of the DCI overlapped with the UTX site
rather than use the averaged DCI values


==
f3_UTX_binding_cor_DCI
f4_UTX_binding_cor_DCI_non_normalized
==
compare DCI distribution at 
- all genomic bins
- bins with UTX binding
- bins with UTX binding and increased H3K4me1
using UTX data from different library


==
f5_UTX_binding_with_extend_cor_DCI
==
compare DCI distribution at 
- all genomic bins
- bins with UTX binding
- bins with UTX binding and increased H3K4me1
while extend the UTX binding sites to 0bp, 20kb, 50kb of each side


==
f6_HM_binding_cor_DCI
==
compare DCI distribution at 
- all genomic bins
- bins with increased k27ac/k4me1 in WT w/ Vector as control
