data_utx_binding
==
for both UTX and UTXFEB, get
- macs2 peaks (WT w/ Vector as control) and 
- sider-df islands (WT compared to Vector)


==
data_binding_patter_readCount
==
for both UTX and UTXFEB, 
get macs2 peaks (WT w/ Vector as control) and sider-df islands 
get the binding pattern of each factor surrounding those regions


==
data_RPKM
==
for both UTX and UTXFEB, 
get macs2 peaks (WT w/ Vector as control) and sider-df islands 
get the RPKM/readCount of each factor at those regions

f0_data_integration
f0_data_integration_v2
f0_data_integration_v3_RPKM
==
to integrate the normalized read count per kb
- by total reads (RPKM), or by total reads is islands 
- at peak/island center +/-500bp or +/-2000bp 
for each factor in each cell type, and calculate the logFC comparing 
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL

xx_v2, add newest k4me2 data

xx_v3_RPKM, normalized as RPKM, and compare between
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT 
- MT2 vs. WT (if with data)
- EIF vs. DEL


==
f1_differential_binding_figs
f1_differential_binding_figs_v2
==
figures showing the differential binding of the normalized read count 
- normalized by total reads (RPKM) at peak/island center +/-500bp for UTX
- normalized by total reads is islands at peak/island center +/-2000bp for others

xx_v2, add newest k4me2 data



==
f2_differential_binding_RPKM_figs
f2_differential_binding_RPKM_figs_v2
==
figures showing the differential binding of the normalized read count
- normalized by total reads (RPKM) at peak/island center +/-2000bp for all factors

xx_v2, add newest k4me2 data


==
f3_UTX_UTXFEB_correlation
==
check the binding correlations between UTX and UTXFEB
