f1_differential_NormReadCount
==
for each factor, get the normalized read counts per kb
- by total reads (RPKM), or by total reads is islands 
- at peak/island center +/-500bp or +/-2000bp 
and calculate the differential binding comparing
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL


==
f2_combined_data
==
to integrate the normalized read count per kb
- normalized by total reads (RPKM) at peak/island center +/-500bp for UTX
- normalized by total reads is islands at peak/island center +/-2000bp for others
for each factor in each cell type, and calculate the logFC comparing 
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL



==
f3_combined_data_RPKM
==
to integrate the normalized read count per kb
- normalized by total reads (RPKM) at peak/island center +/-2000bp for all factors
for each factor in each cell type, and calculate the logFC comparing 
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL
