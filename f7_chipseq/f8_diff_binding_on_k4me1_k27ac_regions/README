==
data_binding_patter_readCount
data_RPKM
==
get the binding pattern and RPKM/readCount
of each factor surrounding the regions 
with increased k4me1/k27ac in WT vs. Vector


==
data_hm_binding
==
regions with increased k4me1/k27ac in WT vs. Vector
- macs2 peaks (WT w/ Vector as control) and 
- sider-df islands (WT compared to Vector)


==
f0_data_integration
==
to integrate the normalized read count per kb
- by total reads (RPKM), or by total reads is islands 
- at peak/island center +/-500bp or +/-2000bp 
for each factor in each cell type, and calculate the logFC comparing 
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL


==
f1_differential_binding_figs
==
figures showing the differential binding and heatmap patterns
of the normalized read count
