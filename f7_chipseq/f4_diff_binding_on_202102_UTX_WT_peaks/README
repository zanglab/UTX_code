==
data_RPKM
==
binding RPKM/readCount at UTX peak regions (center +/-500pb and 2kb) 


==
data_binding_pattern_readCount
==
binding pattern (readCount) of chip-seq on UTX peaks



==
f2_differential_readCount_norm_by_ReadsOnIslands
==
for both differential scatter/MA plot and heatmap
use RPKM for UTX, while 
use read count normalized by total number of reads within merge sicer islads for other factors
(the code here was modified to generate results using both normalization)
