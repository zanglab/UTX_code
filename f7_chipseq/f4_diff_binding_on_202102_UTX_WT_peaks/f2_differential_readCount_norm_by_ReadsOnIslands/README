f1_differential_RPKM_MA
==
differential binding of each factor comparing
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL
reads were normalized by 
- total reads and 
- total reads mapped to SICER islands in ChIP-seq data 
for all factors, for both es500bp and es2000bp

f2_differential_UTX_RPKM_other_normByIslands_scatter
==
differential binding comparing different factors comparing
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL
for UTX, select differential binding from RPKM, es500bp
for others, select differential binding from reads normalized by SICER total reads, es2000bp
