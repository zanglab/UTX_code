==
data_RPKM
==
binding RPKM/readCount at MLL4_islands (islands, and center +/-500pb and 2kb) 


==
data_UTX_overlapped_MLL4
==
MLL4 islands with UTX binding



==
f2_differential_readCount_norm_by_ReadsOnIslands
==
for both differential scatter/MA plot  
use RPKM for UTX, while 
use read count normalized by total number of reads within merge sicer islads for other factors
