RPKM/readCount, binding pattern, and dfiferential binding level fucusong on UDHS
BUT most UTX peaks are not on UDHS
f1_differential_binding_on_UDHS/data_peak_overlap/peaks_on_UDHS/


==
f2_diff_binding_on_202011_UTX_WT_peaks
==
RPKM/readCount, binding pattern, and differential binding level on
2020-11-UTX peaks called from WT using Vector as control


==
f3_diff_binding_on_sicer_df
==
heatmap of binding pattern on SICER islands with differential K4/K27 binding
compared from SICER-df


==
f4_diff_binding_on_202102_UTX_WT_peaks
==
RPKM/readCount, binding pattern, and differential binding level on
2021-02-UTX peaks called from WT using Vector as control



==
f5_diff_binding_on_MLL4_islands
f6_diff_binding_on_H3K4me1_islands
==
RPKM/readCount, differential binding level on MLL4/H3K4me1/H3K4me2 sicer-df islands (WT over Vector)



==
f7_diff_binding_on_UTX_sep_k4me1
==
check chip binding at regions w/ increased UTX in WT compared to Vector control
for both 202011 data and 202102 data
try both MACS2 peaks and sicer-df islands
then focus on those regions with inreased K4me1 binding in WT compared to vector control


==
f8_diff_binding_on_k4me1_k27ac_regions
==
check the HM binding on regions with increased k4me1/k27ac in WT vs. Vector
use both the peaks and islands for k4me1/k27ac
normalized using reads in islands


==
f8_diff_binding_on_k4me1_k27ac_regions_merged_RPKM
==
check the HM binding on ALL regions with k4me1/k27ac (merged peaks from all cell types)
use both the peaks and islands for k4me1/k27ac  
normalized as RPKM


==
f9_diff_binding_on_promoters
==
check the HM binding (RPKM and RP) on gene promoters
