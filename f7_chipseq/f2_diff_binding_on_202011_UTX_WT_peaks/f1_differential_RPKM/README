==
f1_differential_RPKM_MA
==
differential binding of each factor comparing
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL
reads were normalized by total read counts in ChIP-seq data (RPKM)
(MA plots for UTX were used in master slides)


==
f2_differential_RPKM_compr_antibody_scatter
==
differential binding comparing different factors comparing
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL
reads were normalized as RPKM in differential analysis (from f1*)


==
f3_heatmap_compr_WT_Vector
==
heatmap of RPKM binding patterns for each factor surrounding UTX peaks


==
f4_heatmap_compr_WT_Vector_surrounding_DEG
==
heatmap of RPKM binding patterns for each factor 
surrounding UTX peaks that were overlapped with
- all genes
- up genes
- down genes
in WT over Vector as control
