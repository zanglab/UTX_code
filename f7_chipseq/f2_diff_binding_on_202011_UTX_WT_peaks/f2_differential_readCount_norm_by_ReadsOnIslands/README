differential binding of each factor comparing
- WT vs. Vector

reads were normalized by total read counts mapped to SICER islands in ChIP-seq data
(MA plots for all factors excluding UTX were used in master slides)
(MA plots for UTX see ../f1_differential_RPKM/f1_differential_RPKM_MA)

reads were normalized by total read counts mapped to SICER islands in ChIP-seq data
(resultes from f1_differential_RPKM_MA)

for UTX, select differential binding from RPKM, es500bp
for others, select differential binding from reads normalized by SICER total reads, es2000bp

f3_heatmap_compr_WT_Vector
==
for both reads normalized by 
- total read counts in ChIP-seq reads
- total read counts mapped to SICER islands in ChIP-seq reads
plot heatmap of binding patterns for each factor surrounding UTX peaks


==
f4_heatmap_compr_WT_Vector_surrounding_DEG
==
for both reads normalized by 
- total read counts in ChIP-seq reads
- total read counts mapped to SICER islands in ChIP-seq reads
plot heatmap of binding patterns for each factor 
surrounding UTX peaks that were overlapped with
- all genes
- up genes
- down genes
in WT over Vector as control


==
f5_heatmap_compr_WT_Vector_by_diff_HM_binding
==
separate UTX regions into HM binding increased/decreased/not-changed regions for heatmap
