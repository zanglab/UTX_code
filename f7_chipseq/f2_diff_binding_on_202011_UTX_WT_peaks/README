==
data_RPKM
==
binding RPKM/readCount at UTX peak regions (center +/-500pb and 2kb) 


==
data_binding_pattern
data_binding_pattern_readCount
==
binding pattern (RPKM) of chip-seq on UTX peaks, and 
binding pattern (readCount) of chip-seq on UTX peaks


==
data_deg_overlap
==
check the DEG promoter overlapped UTX peaks



==
f1_differential_RPKM
==
differentiall binding (log fold change of RPKM) comparing each factor between two cell types
heatmap of binding signal (RPKM) of each factor between WT and Vector surrounding UTX peaks



==
f2_differential_readCount_norm_by_ReadsOnIslands
==
for both differential scatter/MA plot and heatmap
use read count normalized by total number of reads within merge sicer islads for each factor
(the code here was then modified to generate results using both normalization)



==
f3_UTX_peak_based_RP_on_genes
==
UTX peak based RP on genes, and compare RP of 
All-genes
Up-genes
Down-genes
in WT compared to Vector as control



==
fz_data_combination
==
collect the normalized read count and differential binding for each factor comparing cell types
