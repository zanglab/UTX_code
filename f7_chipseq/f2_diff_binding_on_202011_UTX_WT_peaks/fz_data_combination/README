f1_differential_NormReadCount
==
differential binding of each factor comparing
- WT vs. Vector
- DEL vs. WT
- EIF vs. DEL
using both reads normalized by 
- total read counts in ChIP-seq reads
- total read counts mapped to SICER islands in ChIP-seq reads

For downstream analysis
UTX read counts were normalized by total read counts in ChIP-seq reads
(UTX vector should not have peaks and if normalized by reads in islands, the vector signals would be enhanced).
Others were normalized by totall reads mappined to SICER2 islands in ChIP-seq data.
