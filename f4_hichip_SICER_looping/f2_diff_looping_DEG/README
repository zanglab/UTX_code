==
f1_loop_anchor_with_deg
==
grep all loops whose anchors overlap promoters of DEG of DEL/WT

==
f2_deg_diff_loop_info
==
for loop with anchors overlapped with 
- all genes
- up genes between DEL/WT
- down genes between DEL/WT
check the % of loop occur in all 31 combinations of VEC,WT,DEL,EIF,TPR


!!!!
!! focus on genes rather than loops
!!!!



==
f3_gene_cor_diff_looping
==
collect all the genes with promoters overlapping loops occur/missing in different cells
check % of DEG comparing WT/Vector and DEL/WT

==
f3b_gene_cor_diff_looping_high_threshold
==
same as f3, use the union of loops with fdr<1e-5


==
f4_gene_cor_diff_looping_both_anchor_on_promoter
==
same as f3, only check those loops that both anchors overlapped with gene promoters
collect all genes associating different groups of loops
check % of DEG
