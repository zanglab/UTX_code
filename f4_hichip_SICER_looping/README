==
f0_looping_data_two_libraries
==
hichip looping data call from two libraries: 1st-submission and 202008

==
f0_looping_data_v2
==
re-indexed (id as chr-start-end) looping of new MAPS results
(use the final selected chip-seq data to call SICER islands
and use the merged islands as input for MAPS)


==
f0_looping_genomic_distribution
==
for the HiChIP-seq data in each cell and for each mark
check if the right/left anchor is overlapped with 
- TSS+/-2kb gene promoters
- none promoter UDHS
- others


==
f0_looping_genomic_distribution_v2
==
using reprocessed MAPS results using 
islands from final selected ChIP-seq data


==
f1_diff_looping
==
union the loop, check the occurrence across the celltypes for each loop


==
f2_diff_looping_DEG
==
whether diff loops are associated with DEG comparing
Vector vs. WT
WT vs. DEL
