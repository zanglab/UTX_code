====
f0_data_process
====
QC and process the raw ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and HiChIP datasets
identify DEG

 
====
f1_KDM6A_mutation
====
use public ICGC data to check the clinical results of patients
- with mutations on UTX cIDR regions
- with mutations in UTX
- without mutations in UTX


====
f2_gene_expression
====
# identify DEG between Vector and WT
PCA on all genes and DEG between Vector and WT


====
f3_differential_chip_binding
====
differential binding of K4/K27 markers on
- union peaks/islands
- gene promoter (TSS+/-2kb, TSS+/-10kb)
- gene body
then check the binding patterns of DEG between Vector and WT


====
f4_hichip_SICER_looping
====
HiChIP data processed using MAPS
check the length of loops and genomic positions of loop anchors
check the association between genes and differential loops


==
f4_hichip_MAPS_new
==
HiChIP data processed using MAPS
using the final selected chip-seq data to call SICER islands
and use the merged islands as input for MAPS



==
f5_hichip
==
additional hichip analysis
- HiC-Pro
- BART3D
- FitHiChIP
- hichipper


==
f6_proseq
==
analysis of proseq data



==
f7_chipseq
==
analysis of final selected QC passed chipseq data
