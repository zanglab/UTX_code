Enhancers was selected as those H3K4me1 or H3K27ac islands (across all cell types) that overlap with UTX peaks (WT with Vector as control) 
Then select the PRO-seq peaks that were on enhancers and check the PRO-seq signals across samples.

H3K4me1_overlapping_H3K27ac_overlapping_UTX - RPO-seq overlapping (UTX that are on H3K4me1_overlapping_H3K27ac)
H3K27ac_H3K4me1_with_UTX - RPO-seq overlapping either H3K27ac w/ UTX or H3K4me1 w/ UTX

f1_extract_data
==
extract the signal of enhancer-overlapped RPO-seq peaks (smaller sized file for easier analysis)

f2_heatmap_RPO-seq_at_enhancer_combi_rep
==
merge/combine/average two replicates
show the RPO-seq signals at enhancers 


==
f2b_heatmap_RPO-seq_at_enhancer_combi_rep_sep_promoter_overlap
==
merge/combine/average two replicates
show the RPO-seq signals at enhancers 
separate into promoter-overlapped and non-overlapped regions



==
f3_RPO-seq_at_enhancer_replicate_combined_log2FC_scatter
==
check if the RPO-seq changes in WT over Vector were reversed/rescued by DEL
RPKM on Proseq calculated as average of RPKM from the +/-2kb binding patterns

re-calculate the PRKM and plot the figs
separate regions into promoter-overlapped and non-overlapped groups
## make sure you use the RPKM column, and 
## make sure you directly plot the scatters rather than fit by color density


==
f4_heatmap_RPO-seq_at_enhancer_combi_rep_WT_changed
==
RPO-seq signals at enhancers that have decreased/increased RPO-seq binding in WT over Vector


==
f5_heatmap_RPO-seq_at_enhancer_combi_rep_WT_changed_rep_Promoter_overlap
==
RPO-seq signals at enhancers that 
- overlapped or NOT overlapped with Promoters, and 
- have decreased/increased RPO-seq binding in WT over Vector
